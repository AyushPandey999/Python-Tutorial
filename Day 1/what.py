# What is Programming Language ?

"""
Programming is the process of creating sets of instruction that tell a computer how to perform specific task.

Popular Programming Languages : C,C++,Java,Python...etc 
"""

# What is Python ?

""" 
Python is a High-Level Oject-Oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
Python is Created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.
"""

# Features of Python ?

""" 
1) High-Level language.
2) Object Oriented language.
3) Interpreted language.
4) Scripting language.
5) Dynamic Typed language.
6) Huge Set of Libraries and In-built Function.
7) Easy to understand.
8) Easy to learn.
9) Platform Independent.
10) Open-Source and Free.

# Difference between high level , mid level , low level language ?

"""" 
High level language : The language which is easily understandable by human but needs translation for computers. ex : python,java..etc.

Mid level language : The language which is partially understandable by human and computer. ex : c,c++.

Low level language : The language which is easily understandable by computer but difficult for humans. ex : machine language,assembly language.
"""

# Object Oriented ?

""" 
Python support object oriented concepts such as classes , objects , inheritance , encapsulation , polymorphism . Object oriented helps
organize code and makes it reusable and easier to maintain.
"""

# Intepreted language ?

""" 
The language which executes the code line by line and stop at the error . You don't need to compile your code before running it , which
makes debuging and testing much faster.
"""

# Scripting Language ?
""" 
A scripting language is a type of programming language that use an interpreter as its translator and is mainly used to automates
tasks or control other application.
"""

# Dynamic Type Language ?

"""
In Python , You don't need to declare variable type explicitly. it declare the variable type during run time.
"""

# Huge set of library and in-built function ?

"""
Python provides a large collection of built-in functions and libraries that help perform various tasks like math , data handling , 
web development , and machine learning easily.
"""

# Platform Independent ?
"""
Python is a cross platform , meaning code is written on one OS like window can run on other like Linux without modification.
"""

# Open Source and Free ?

""" 
Python is free to download and use and its source code is open to developer so , developer can contribute , modify , or use it freely.
"""

# Story behind python ?

"""
In December 1989 , Guido van rossum started working on a new programming language while at CWI(centrum wiskunde & informatica) in 
natherland and release it publicly in 1991 as name python . so , python name is not taken from snake it's taken from guido's favourite 
show Monty Python's comedy Flying Circus which is telecast in bbc chennel because guido wants a unique , simple and easily redable name.
"""

# Career with python ?

""" 
Python is not only one of the most popular programming language in the world but it also offers great carrer opportunities . The demand
for python developers is growing every year for web development , data science and analytics , software development.
"""

# Difference between Interpreter and compiler ?

"""
1)
Interpreter : An Interpreter translates and executes a source code line by line as the code runs.

Compiler : A Compiler translates the entire code into machine code before the program runs.

2)
Interpreter : An Interpreter executes line by line.

Compiler : A Compiler executes entire program at once.

3)
Interpreter : An Interpreter easier to debug as it stop at the first error encountered.

Compiler : A Compiler harder to debug because errors and reported after the entire code is compiled.

4)
Interpreter : Example -> Python , Ruby , JavaScript , and PHP.

Compiler : Example -> C , C++ , Java , and Go.
